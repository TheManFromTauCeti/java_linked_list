Linked List for Java
====================

These files represent my implementation of a [Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) in Java. These files are part of a larger repo I made
for an assignment in a data strucutres course from the [BIT program](https://catalogue.rrc.ca/Programs/WPG/Fulltime/BUSGF-DP) 
at [Red River College](https://www.rrc.ca/) :)

Note
----
As Mentioned above, these are part of a larger repo. However, I am not able to post those files here. The files I can post
I have posted. Simply put these files don't really do much on their own. I've placed them
here for anyone who wants some ideas on how to implement their own linked list.
